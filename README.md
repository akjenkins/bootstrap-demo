In-class demo on 4/9/19 on bootstrap

Discussion:
When do you think you might be able to use Bootstrap in the future? When would you not want to?
Bootstrap could come in handy if I really need to make a website quickly or if my main goal is not to have a website that is unique and
special but just have a website that is a vessel for some information (i.e. when design isn't as important). I would not want to use it
if I want to make something unique, flex my web dev muscles, and if I have the time to really make something special.

What are some issues/downsides you could run into by using Bootstrap in industry?
Creators don't want their websites to look like everyone else, so that's not great. Readability is also decreased, so if I had to work
on a webpage that someone else made before me with Bootstrap, it may be difficult to understand what they've made in order to change things.
